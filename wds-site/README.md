# I LOVEEE WDS 

##WDS Project

Simple messaging app that connects a React frontend to a MongoDB DB, storing accounts and message logs...

## How it Works

Create an account, login, type some convo starter (eg. "I need cs help") and create a bubble with an attraction force that you can drag around. Feeds into a global DB of bubbles that are available to other users.

If you want to start a conversation with another user, just pop their bubble and start a chat in the messages window!
